## How do members of Kings' Azit DAO make investment decisions?

In the spirit of The DAO, Kings' Azit DAO is entirely member directed and managed and any blockchain-based project can apply for funding from Kings' Azit DAO. As a member, you should have some experience in evaluating and investing in startups relying on digital assets.

Each member will have the opportunity to nominate any applicant for funding through the DApp. Once nominated, members or their delegates will have the right to vote on whether to invest in a project through the DApp.

If more members agree vote for an investment than reject an investment during the applicable voting period, The Members will authorize the investment. After a seven day period to enable Members to "rage quit," Kings' Azit DAO DApp will generate the necessary legal agreements and send them to a designated representative for signature. Once digitally signed, Kings' Azit DAO will transfer the investment to the project.

**A Kings member should understand and acknowledge that they must bear the economic risk of this investment.**
