# What is Kings' Azit DAO?

> First, it should be noted that this document is a fork of **The LAO** document and modified to fit the Kings' Azit DAO.

Kings’ Azit DAO is a for-profit DAO created by Kings’ Azit for the purpose of investing in early-stage companies. Built on top of crypto infrastructure, it offers radical flexibility compared to traditional “venture capital fund” models.

Our investments are self-executed by DAO members. All members have the right to vote on deal sourcing, due diligence, proposals and investments. New members' DAO registration is a permission system, and existing members select them. On the other hand, the ability to withdraw from DAO is completely permissionless, and members who withdraw are guaranteed full pro rata of DAO assets at any time. KAD's initial members consist of founders, developers, and investors in various fields, as well as existing members of Kings' Azit.

Kings' Azit DAO is organized as a legal entity primarily administered via an online application (a "DApp") and related smart contracts.

More details about Kings' Azit DAO's legal structure, operation, and funding process are outlined in these docs. Please read them carefully before becoming a member of Kings' Azit DAO or seeking funding from Kings' Azit DAO.
