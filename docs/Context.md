Kings’ Azit started in the summer of 2021 as a community where current founders’ acquaintances gathered to enjoy Texas Hold’em. This small gathering, which started in a small space in Seocho-dong Seorae Village, quickly grew in number based on recommendations and invitations from acquaintances, and in the winter of 2021, it became a community of 200 people.

As the number of people increased, a big tournament was held once a week, and special golden physical cards were given to those who placed first in the tournament, along with matching NFTs. Despite the fact that few community members were familiar with crypto technology at the time, they all felt a string attraction to NFTs, and more and more members participated in tournaments to earn NFTs.

When the number of NFT holders exceeded 100, the founders of Kings’ Azit began to think about how these NFTs could be used in close connection with the expansion of the community, rather than just mere souvenirs. We have carried out a number of projects to promote the community widely, such as making NFTs available in the form of vouchers in partnership with offline spaces (dentistry, dermatology, malt bar, etc.) operated by Kings' Azit members. To bring these efforts together and build a more scalable community, we created “Kings’ Azit DAO”.
